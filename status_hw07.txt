Web Dev Fall 2019 HW07 Status

Answer the following questions:


1. What's your name?

Marielle Riveros

2. What's the URL of the github repo with your work for this HW?

https://github.com/marielle1022/time1

3. What's the version number of your github release?

Unclear on what this is on github -- most recent commit is "status page 7 update"

4. What's the URL that you deployed to?

time2.mgrathena.info

5. Is your app functionality complete? If not, what's missing?
No -- it's hard to tell what might be working or not because the "state.session is null" error leads to a blank page.
I know that I was definitely able to create a timesheet with drop-down menus of job codes (commit: 84064cded43305711baee18a1e3e235a8fa3e6ef)


6. Is your app properly deployed? If not, what went wrong?
Yes.
