# Timesheet

Design Decisions:
  * Created a single database for users which includes both managers and workers
       * When registering for an account, users specify their role (manager/worker)
       * This information is stored under "role" in the user table
       * This allows for a simpler registration
       * If there was more time, I would like to create different worker/manager databases -- I think using the "has-many"       relationship would make it simpler to allow managers to approve different timesheets.
  * Used drop-down menus for job codes
       * This restricts users to specific job codes
       * No ambiguity is allowed
  * Note: there are many "Question" comments in the code. I was unable to solve the "state.session is null" error, which prevented me from seeing the other parts of the code in action. If I had been able to see what sort of behavior or errors were generated by other parts of the code, I would have been able to make much more progress in answering that myriad of questions.
